Reporting a Bug
===
This is the format you should try to use when posting a bug report.

When posting bugs, please use this template:

    Operating System:
    
    
    Version of Java:
    
    
    Pack version:
    
    
    Description of problem:
    
    
    Steps to reproduce problem:
    
    
    Crash/error report:
    ```
    
    ```
Put the crash log between the backticks, and make sure to end each non-log line
with two spaces.

Crash reports are found in one of two places:

If the crash happens before the pack has loaded, the crash reports are found
in `.technic/modpacks/egeeio-modded-mc/`, and are generally called
`ForgeModLoader-client-{number}`. Find the most recent one and copy it over.

If the crash happens while the game is running, crash reports are found in
`.technic/modpacks/egeeio-modded-mc/crash-reports`. Find the most recent one
copy it over.

If the log is very long, please upload it
[here](http://paste.ubuntu.com/). It's like pastebin with no max length.

Remember, clearly formatted reports are more useful than large blocks of text.
